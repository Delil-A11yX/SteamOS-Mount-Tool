### 🤔 Troubleshooting

**Problem:** "When I double-click the file, it just opens in a text editor instead of asking to 'Execute'."

**Solution:** This can happen on some Linux setups. It means you need to give the file permission to run one time.
1.  **Right-click** the `Easy-Mount-Tool.desktop` file on your Desktop.
2.  Go to **Properties** -> **Permissions**.
3.  Check the box that says **"Is executable"**.
4.  Close the window and try double-clicking it again.
